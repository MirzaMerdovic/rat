# :rat: Rat
The :rat: is a (yet another) configuration provider that can be used for resolving service configuration entries. It may be useful 
in situation where your services have big configuration files with many entries so putting them in environment variables becomes 
cumbersome and hard to maintain. Using :rat: would theoretical leave you with only one environment variable the :rat: URL. Retrieving configuration entries works the standard KV way where you provider a key for a specific value.
